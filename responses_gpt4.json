This extensive body of ice is indeed a critical part of the global climate system, influencing sea level and weather patterns across the planet.\n\nThe mention of \"ominous\" likely refers to the concerns surrounding the impacts of climate change on polar ice sheets. The Antarctic Ice Sheet has been experiencing significant changes due to global warming. Melting ice sheets contribute to rising sea levels, which can lead to coastal erosion, increased flooding, and other impacts that threaten environments, wildlife, and human communities globally.

The Imperial family is often involved in many ceremonial duties and state functions, yet they maintain a very private life in many respects.
