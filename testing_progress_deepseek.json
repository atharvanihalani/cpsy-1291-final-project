It contains about **60% of the world's fresh water** and has an average thickness of around **2,160 meters (7,090 feet)**, with some areas reaching up to **4,776 meters (15,669 feet)** thick. \n\nThe Antarctic Ice Sheet is divided into two main parts:  \n1. **East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS)** – The larger and more stable portion.  \n2. **West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS)** – Smaller and more vulnerable to melting due to climate change.  \n\nFor comparison, the second-largest ice sheet is the **Greenland Ice Sheet**, which is about one-eighth the size of Antarctica's."

If it were to melt entirely (which wouldn't happen suddenly), global sea levels would rise by about **58 meters (190 feet)**—so yes, that’s *extremely* ominous.  \n\nWhile Antarctica’s ice is melting at an accelerating rate due to climate change, complete collapse would take centuries. Still, even partial melting could destabilize ecosystems, flood coastal cities, and disrupt ocean currents. The fact that scientists are closely monitoring its \"doomsday\" glaciers (like Thwaites) adds to the unease.  \n\nSo, short answer: **It’s in Antarctica, and yes—it’s a chilling reminder of climate change’s stakes.** ❄️🔥"
